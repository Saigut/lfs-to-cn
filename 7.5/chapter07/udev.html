        Module Handling on an LFS System
      </h1>
      <p>
        In <a class="xref" href="../chapter06/chapter06.html" title=
        "第&nbsp;6&nbsp;章&nbsp;Installing Basic System Software">第 6 章</a>, we
        installed the Udev package. Before we go into the details regarding
        how this works, a brief history of previous methods of handling
        devices is in order.
      </p>
      <p>
        Linux systems in general traditionally use a static device creation
        method, whereby a great many device nodes are created under
        <code class="filename">/dev</code> (sometimes literally thousands of
        nodes), regardless of whether the corresponding hardware devices
        actually exist. This is typically done via a <span class=
        "command"><strong>MAKEDEV</strong></span> script, which contains a
        number of calls to the <span class=
        "command"><strong>mknod</strong></span> program with the relevant
        major and minor device numbers for every possible device that might
        exist in the world.
      </p>
      <p>
        Using the Udev method, only those devices which are detected by the
        kernel get device nodes created for them. Because these device nodes
        will be created each time the system boots, they will be stored on a
        <code class="systemitem">devtmpfs</code> file system (a virtual file
        system that resides entirely in system memory). Device nodes do not
        require much space, so the memory that is used is negligible.
      </p>
      <div class="sect2" lang="zh-cn" xml:lang="zh-cn">
        <h2 class="sect2">
          7.4.1. History
        </h2>
        <p>
          In February 2000, a new filesystem called <code class=
          "systemitem">devfs</code> was merged into the 2.3.46 kernel and was
          made available during the 2.4 series of stable kernels. Although it
          was present in the kernel source itself, this method of creating
          devices dynamically never received overwhelming support from the
          core kernel developers.
        </p>
        <p>
          The main problem with the approach adopted by <code class=
          "systemitem">devfs</code> was the way it handled device detection,
          creation, and naming. The latter issue, that of device node naming,
          was perhaps the most critical. It is generally accepted that if
          device names are allowed to be configurable, then the device naming
          policy should be up to a system administrator, not imposed on them
          by any particular developer(s). The <code class=
          "systemitem">devfs</code> file system also suffers from race
          conditions that are inherent in its design and cannot be fixed
          without a substantial revision to the kernel. It was marked as
          deprecated for a long period – due to a lack of maintenance – and
          was finally removed from the kernel in June, 2006.
        </p>
        <p>
          With the development of the unstable 2.5 kernel tree, later
          released as the 2.6 series of stable kernels, a new virtual
          filesystem called <code class="systemitem">sysfs</code> came to be.
          The job of <code class="systemitem">sysfs</code> is to export a
          view of the system's hardware configuration to userspace processes.
          With this userspace-visible representation, the possibility of
          seeing a userspace replacement for <code class=
          "systemitem">devfs</code> became much more realistic.

          <p>
            The <code class="systemitem">sysfs</code> filesystem was
            mentioned briefly above. One may wonder how <code class=
            "systemitem">sysfs</code> knows about the devices present on a
            system and what device numbers should be used for them. Drivers
            that have been compiled into the kernel directly register their
            objects with a <code class="systemitem">sysfs</code> (devtmpfs
            internally) as they are detected by the kernel. For drivers
            compiled as modules, this registration will happen when the
            module is loaded. Once the <code class="systemitem">sysfs</code>
            filesystem is mounted (on /sys), data which the drivers register
            with <code class="systemitem">sysfs</code> are available to
            userspace processes and to udevd for processing (including
            modifications to device nodes).

            7.4.2.2. Device Node Creation
          </h3>
          <p>
            Device files are created by the kernel by the <code class=
            "systemitem">devtmpfs</code> filesystem. Any driver that wishes
            to register a device node will go through <code class=
            "systemitem">devtmpfs</code> (via the driver core) to do it. When
            a <code class="systemitem">devtmpfs</code> instance is mounted on
            <code class="filename">/dev</code>, the device node will
            initially be created with a fixed name, permissions, and owner.
          </p>
          <p>
            A short time later, the kernel will send a uevent to <span class=
            "command"><strong>udevd</strong></span>. Based on the rules
            specified in the files within the <code class=
            "filename">/etc/udev/rules.d</code>, <code class=
            "filename">/lib/udev/rules.d</code>, and <code class=
            "filename">/run/udev/rules.d</code> directories, <span class=
            "command"><strong>udevd</strong></span> will create additional
            symlinks to the device node, or change its permissions, owner, or
            group, or modify the internal <span class=
            "command"><strong>udevd</strong></span> database entry (name) for
            that object.
          </p>
          <p>
            The rules in these three directories are numbered in a similar
            fashion to the LFS-Bootscripts package and all three directories
            are merged together. If <span class=
            "command"><strong>udevd</strong></span> can't find a rule for the
            device it is creating, it will leave the permissions and
            ownership at whatever <code class="systemitem">devtmpfs</code>
            used initially.

          <p>
            The first LFS bootscript, <code class=
            "filename">/etc/init.d/mountvirtfs</code> will copy any devices
            located in <code class="filename">/lib/udev/devices</code> to
            <code class="filename">/dev</code>. This is necessary because
            some devices, directories, and symlinks are needed before the
            dynamic device handling processes are available during the early
            stages of booting a system, or are required by <span class=
            "command"><strong>udevd</strong></span> itself. Creating static
            device nodes in <code class="filename">/lib/udev/devices</code>
            also provides an easy workaround for devices that are not
            supported by the dynamic device handling infrastructure.
          </p>
          <p>
            The <code class="filename">/etc/rc.d/init.d/udev</code>
            initscript starts <span class=
            "command"><strong>udevd</strong></span>, triggers any "coldplug"
            devices that have already been created by the kernel and waits
            for any rules to complete. The script also unsets the uevent
            handler from the default of <code class=
            "filename">/sbin/hotplug</code> . This is done because the kernel
            no longer needs to call out to an external binary. Instead
            <span class="command"><strong>udevd</strong></span> will listen
            on a netlink socket for uevents that the kernel raises.
          </p>
          <p>
            The <span class=
            "command"><strong>/etc/rc.d/init.d/udev_retry</strong></span>
            initscript takes care of re-triggering events for subsystems
            whose rules may rely on filesystems that are not mounted until
            the <span class="command"><strong>mountfs</strong></span> script
            is run (in particular, <code class="filename">/usr</code> and
            <code class="filename">/var</code> may cause this). This script
            runs after the <span class=
            "command"><strong>mountfs</strong></span> script, so those rules
            (if re-triggered) should succeed the second time around. It is
            configured from the <code class=
            "filename">/etc/sysconfig/udev_retry</code> file; any words in
            this file other than comments are considered subsystem names to
            trigger at retry time. To find the subsystem of a device, use
            <span class="command"><strong>udevadm info --attribute-walk
            &lt;device&gt;</strong></span> where &lt;device&gt; is an
            absolute path in /dev or /sys such as /dev/sr0 or /sys/class/rtc.

            7.4.2.4. Module Loading
          </h3>
          <p>
            Device drivers compiled as modules may have aliases built into
            them. Aliases are visible in the output of the <span class=
            "command"><strong>modinfo</strong></span> program and are usually
            related to the bus-specific identifiers of devices supported by a
            module. For example, the <span class=
            "emphasis"><em>snd-fm801</em></span> driver supports PCI devices
            with vendor ID 0x1319 and device ID 0x0801, and has an alias of
            <span class="quote">“<span class=
            "quote">pci:v00001319d00000801sv*sd*bc04sc01i*</span>”</span>.
            For most devices, the bus driver exports the alias of the driver
            that would handle the device via <code class=
            "systemitem">sysfs</code>. E.g., the <code class=
            "filename">/sys/bus/pci/devices/0000:00:0d.0/modalias</code> file
            might contain the string <span class="quote">“<span class=
            "quote">pci:v00001319d00000801sv00001319sd00001319bc04sc01i00</span>”</span>.
            The default rules provided with Udev will cause <span class=
            "command"><strong>udevd</strong></span> to call out to
            <span class="command"><strong>/sbin/modprobe</strong></span> with
            the contents of the <code class="envar">MODALIAS</code> uevent
            environment variable (which should be the same as the contents of
            the <code class="filename">modalias</code> file in sysfs), thus
            loading all modules whose aliases match this string after
            wildcard expansion.
          </p>
          <p>
            In this example, this means that, in addition to <span class=
            "emphasis"><em>snd-fm801</em></span>, the obsolete (and unwanted)
            <span class="emphasis"><em>forte</em></span> driver will be

          7.4.3. Problems with Loading Modules and Creating Devices
        </h2>
        <p>
          There are a few possible problems when it comes to automatically
          creating device nodes.

        <div class="sect3">
          <h3 class="sect3">
            7.4.3.1. A kernel module is not loaded automatically
          </h3>
          <p>
            Udev will only load a module if it has a bus-specific alias and
            the bus driver properly exports the necessary aliases to
            <code class="systemitem">sysfs</code>. In other cases, one should
            arrange module loading by other means. With Linux-3.13.3, Udev is
            known to load properly-written drivers for INPUT, IDE, PCI, USB,
            SCSI, SERIO, and FireWire devices.
          </p>
          <p>
            To determine if the device driver you require has the necessary
            support for Udev, run <span class=
            "command"><strong>modinfo</strong></span> with the module name as
            the argument. Now try locating the device directory under
            <code class="filename">/sys/bus</code> and check whether there is
            a <code class="filename">modalias</code> file there.
          </p>
          <p>
            If the <code class="filename">modalias</code> file exists in
            <code class="systemitem">sysfs</code>, the driver supports the
            device and can talk to it directly, but doesn't have the alias,
            it is a bug in the driver. Load the driver without the help from
            Udev and expect the issue to be fixed later.
          </p>
          <p>
            If there is no <code class="filename">modalias</code> file in the
            relevant directory under <code class="filename">/sys/bus</code>,
            this means that the kernel developers have not yet added modalias
            support to this bus type. With Linux-3.13.3, this is the case
            with ISA busses. Expect this issue to be fixed in later kernel
            versions.

            <span class="command"><strong>modprobe</strong></span> to load
            the wrapper after Udev loads the wrapped module. To do this, add
            a <span class="quote">“<span class="quote">softdep</span>”</span>

          <p>
            Either don't build the module, or blacklist it in a <code class=
            "filename">/etc/modprobe.d/blacklist.conf</code> file as done
            with the <span class="emphasis"><em>forte</em></span> module in
            the example below:
          </p>
          <pre class="screen">
<code class="literal">blacklist forte</code>
</pre>
          <p>
            Blacklisted modules can still be loaded manually with the
            explicit <span class="command"><strong>modprobe</strong></span>
            command.

          </h3>
          <p>
            This usually happens if a rule unexpectedly matches a device. For
            example, a poorly-writen rule can match both a SCSI disk (as
            desired) and the corresponding SCSI generic device (incorrectly)
            by vendor. Find the offending rule and make it more specific,
            with the help of the <span class="command"><strong>udevadm
            info</strong></span> command.

            7.4.3.5. Udev rule works unreliably
          </h3>
          <p>
            This may be another manifestation of the previous problem. If
            not, and your rule uses <code class="systemitem">sysfs</code>
            attributes, it may be a kernel timing issue, to be fixed in later
            kernels. For now, you can work around it by creating a rule that
            waits for the used <code class="systemitem">sysfs</code>
            attribute and appending it to the <code class=
            "filename">/etc/udev/rules.d/10-wait_for_sysfs.rules</code> file
            (create this file if it does not exist). Please notify the LFS
            Development list if you do so and it helps.

            7.4.3.6. Udev does not create a device
          </h3>
          <p>
            Further text assumes that the driver is built statically into the
            kernel or already loaded as a module, and that you have already
            checked that Udev doesn't create a misnamed device.
          </p>
          <p>
            Udev has no information needed to create a device node if a
            kernel driver does not export its data to <code class=
            "systemitem">sysfs</code>. This is most common with third party
            drivers from outside the kernel tree. Create a static device node
            in <code class="filename">/lib/udev/devices</code> with the
            appropriate major/minor numbers (see the file <code class=
            "filename">devices.txt</code> inside the kernel documentation or
            the documentation provided by the third party driver vendor). The
            static device node will be copied to <code class=
            "filename">/dev</code> by the <span class=
            "command"><strong>udev</strong></span> bootscript.

            7.4.3.7. Device naming order changes randomly after rebooting
          </h3>
          <p>
            This is due to the fact that Udev, by design, handles uevents and
            loads modules in parallel, and thus in an unpredictable order.
            This will never be <span class="quote">“<span class=
            "quote">fixed</span>”</span>. You should not rely upon the kernel
            device names being stable. Instead, create your own rules that
            make symlinks with stable names based on some stable attributes
            of the device, such as a serial number or the output of various
            *_id utilities installed by Udev. See <a class="xref" href=
