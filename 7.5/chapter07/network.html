        Network Configuration

      <p>
        This section only applies if a network card is to be configured.
      </p>
      <p>
        If a network card will not be used, there is likely no need to create
        any configuration files relating to network cards. If that is the
        case, you will need to remove the <code class=
        "filename">network</code> symlinks from all run-level directories
        (<code class="filename">/etc/rc.d/rc*.d</code>) after the bootscripts
        are installed in <a class="xref" href="bootscripts.html" title=

          Creating stable names for network interfaces
        </h2>
        <p>
          If there is only one network interface in the system to be
          configured, this section is optional, although it will never be
          wrong to do it. In many cases (e.g. a laptop with a wireless and a
          wired interface), accomplishing the configuration in this section
          is necessary.
        </p>
        <p>
          With Udev and modular network drivers, the network interface
          numbering is not persistent across reboots by default, because the
          drivers are loaded in parallel and, thus, in random order. For
          example, on a computer having two network cards made by Intel and
          Realtek, the network card manufactured by Intel may become
          <code class="filename">eth0</code> and the Realtek card becomes
          <code class="filename">eth1</code>. In some cases, after a reboot
          the cards get renumbered the other way around. To avoid this, Udev
          comes with a script and some rules to assign stable names to
          network cards based on their MAC address.
        </p>
        <p>
          The rules were pre-generated in the build instructions for
          <span class="application">udev (systemd)</span> in the last
          chapter. Inspect the <code class=
          "filename">/etc/udev/rules.d/70-persistent-net.rules</code> file,
          to find out which name was assigned to which network device:
        </p>
        <pre class="userinput">
<kbd class="command">cat /etc/udev/rules.d/70-persistent-net.rules</kbd>
</pre>
        <div class="admon note">
          <img alt="[注意]" src="../images/note.png" />
          <h3>
            注意
          </h3>
          <p>
            In some cases such as when MAC addresess have been assigned to a
            network card manually or in a virtual environment such as Xen,
            the network rules file may not have been generated because
            addresses are not consistently assigned. In these cases, just
            continue to the next section.
          </p>
        </div>
        <p>
          The file begins with a comment block followed by two lines for each
          NIC. The first line for each NIC is a commented description showing
          its hardware IDs (e.g. its PCI vendor and device IDs, if it's a PCI
          card), along with its driver in parentheses, if the driver can be
          found. Neither the hardware ID nor the driver is used to determine
          which name to give an interface; this information is only for
          reference. The second line is the Udev rule that matches this NIC
          and actually assigns it a name.
        </p>
        <p>
          All Udev rules are made up of several keys, separated by commas and
          optional whitespace. This rule's keys and an explanation of each of
          them are as follows:
        </p>
        <div class="itemizedlist">
          <ul>

                <code class="literal">SUBSYSTEM=="net"</code> - This tells
                Udev to ignore devices that are not network cards.
              </p>
            </li>
            <li class="listitem">
              <p>
                <code class="literal">ACTION=="add"</code> - This tells Udev
                to ignore this rule for a uevent that isn't an add ("remove"
                and "change" uevents also happen, but don't need to rename
                network interfaces).
              </p>
            </li>
            <li class="listitem">

                that Udev will ignore VLAN or bridge sub-interfaces (because
                these sub-interfaces do not have drivers). These
                sub-interfaces are skipped because the name that would be
                assigned would collide with their parent devices.

                the rule only matches the primary interface in the case of
                certain wireless drivers, which create multiple virtual
                interfaces. The secondary interfaces are skipped for the same
                reason that VLAN and bridge sub-interfaces are skipped: there
                would be a name collision otherwise.

                multiple network interfaces, all with the same MAC address
                (the PS3 is one such machine). If the independent interfaces
                have different basenames, this key will allow Udev to tell
                them apart. This is generally not necessary for most Linux
                From Scratch users, but does not hurt.

          7.2.2. Creating Network Interface Configuration Files
        </h2>
        <p>
          Which interfaces are brought up and down by the network script
          depends on the files in <code class=
          "filename">/etc/sysconfig/</code>. This directory should contain a
          file for each interface to be configured, such as <code class=
          "filename">ifconfig.xyz</code>, where <span class=
          "quote">“<span class="quote">xyz</span>”</span> is meaningful to
          the administrator such as the device name (e.g. eth0). Inside this
          file are attributes to this interface, such as its IP address(es),
          subnet masks, and so forth. It is necessary that the stem of the
          filename be <span class="emphasis"><em>ifconfig</em></span>.
        </p>
        <p>
          The following command creates a sample file for the <span class=
          "emphasis"><em>eth0</em></span> device with a static IP address:
        </p>
        <pre class="userinput">
<kbd class="command">cd /etc/sysconfig/
cat &gt; ifconfig.eth0 &lt;&lt; "EOF"
<code class="literal">ONBOOT=yes
IFACE=eth0
SERVICE=ipv4-static
IP=192.168.1.1
GATEWAY=192.168.1.2
PREFIX=24
BROADCAST=192.168.1.255</code>
EOF</kbd>
</pre>
        <p>
          The values of these variables must be changed in every file to
          match the proper setup.
        </p>
        <p>
          If the <code class="envar">ONBOOT</code> variable is set to
          <span class="quote">“<span class="quote">yes</span>”</span> the
          network script will bring up the Network Interface Card (NIC)
          during booting of the system. If set to anything but <span class=
          "quote">“<span class="quote">yes</span>”</span> the NIC will be
          ignored by the network script and not be automatically brought up.
          The interface can be manually started or stopped with the
          <span class="command"><strong>ifup</strong></span> and <span class=
          "command"><strong>ifdown</strong></span> commands.
        </p>
        <p>
          The <code class="envar">IFACE</code> variable defines the interface
          name, for example, eth0. It is required for all network device
          configuration files.
        </p>
        <p>
          The <code class="envar">SERVICE</code> variable defines the method
          used for obtaining the IP address. The LFS-Bootscripts package has
          a modular IP assignment format, and creating additional files in
          the <code class="filename">/lib/services/</code> directory allows
          other IP assignment methods. This is commonly used for Dynamic Host
          Configuration Protocol (DHCP), which is addressed in the BLFS book.
        </p>
        <p>
          The <code class="envar">GATEWAY</code> variable should contain the
          default gateway IP address, if one is present. If not, then comment
          out the variable entirely.
        </p>
        <p>
          The <code class="envar">PREFIX</code> variable contains the number
          of bits used in the subnet. Each octet in an IP address is 8 bits.
          If the subnet's netmask is 255.255.255.0, then it is using the
          first three octets (24 bits) to specify the network number. If the
          netmask is 255.255.255.240, it would be using the first 28 bits.
          Prefixes longer than 24 bits are commonly used by DSL and
          cable-based Internet Service Providers (ISPs). In this example
          (PREFIX=24), the netmask is 255.255.255.0. Adjust the <code class=
          "envar">PREFIX</code> variable according to your specific subnet.
          If omitted, the PREFIX defaults to 24.
        </p>

        </h2>
        <p>
          If the system is going to be connected to the Internet, it will
          need some means of Domain Name Service (DNS) name resolution to
          resolve Internet domain names to IP addresses, and vice versa. This
          is best achieved by placing the IP address of the DNS server,
          available from the ISP or network administrator, into <code class=
          "filename">/etc/resolv.conf</code>. Create the file by running the
          following:
        </p>
        <pre class="userinput">
<kbd class="command">cat &gt; /etc/resolv.conf &lt;&lt; "EOF"

# End /etc/resolv.conf</code>
EOF</kbd>
</pre>
        <p>
          The <code class="varname">domain</code> statement can be omitted or
          replaced with a <code class="varname">search</code> statement. See
          the man page for resolv.conf for more details.
        </p>
        <p>
          Replace <em class="replaceable"><code>&lt;IP address of the
          nameserver&gt;</code></em> with the IP address of the DNS most
          appropriate for the setup. There will often be more than one entry
          (requirements demand secondary servers for fallback capability). If
          you only need or want one DNS server, remove the second
          <span class="emphasis"><em>nameserver</em></span> line from the
          file. The IP address may also be a router on the local network.
